# Promissing-SQLite3

A simple wrapper for sqlite3 that uses promisses to make your code more readable.
This also adds functions to execute prepared statemenst in one line making it easy to use sql commands from an external file.

#### This works for me!
This libary is not complete, was only testet on my machine not using all commands, and is very likely to include bugs.
DO NOT USE THIS FOR IMPORTAND PROJECTS!!

I would be happy if anyone could help me making an actually good libary out of this. Just reach out to me!
